# **HTML & CSS Practice - Landing Pages**

This repository is a practice project aimed at enhancing skills in HTML and CSS by creating 22 responsive landing pages. Each page is based on designs sourced from the [Figma Community File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1127302394641561751).

## **Features**

- **Git Branching**: Each landing page is stored in its respective branch. The branches are named as follows:
  - `1` to `17`
  - `23`, `24`
  - `44`, `46`
- **Design Implementation**: Pages are designed to match the Figma reference closely, focusing on layout precision.
- **Live Server Integration**: Pages are best visualized by switching branches and running a local development server (e.g., Live Server).

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Juannnrv/landingPageDesigns.git
   cd landingPageDesigns
   ```

2. Switch to the desired branch:

   ```
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

   Replace `<branch-name>` with the corresponding branch number (`1`, `2`, ..., `46`).

3. Run a live server:

   - Install the **Live Server** extension in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Open the `index.html` file of the selected branch.
   - Start the live server to view the page in your browser.

## **Skills Practiced**

- HTML structure and semantic markup.
- CSS layout techniques, including Flexbox.
- Git version control for branch-specific workflows.
